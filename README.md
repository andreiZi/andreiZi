Hi, my name is Andrei 👋🏽

I am a Software Engineer and the CEO of Codinental, a company driven by a passion for computer science and technology. I've been programming since I was 14 and plan to continue for the rest of my life.

Designing architectures, building them, and making things work in general fulfills me more than anything else. I specialize in the development of microservices on Kubernetes, primarily using ASP.NET Core for the backend and React or Svelte for the frontend. However, my expertise is not limited to these technologies; I have also worked with PHP, Haskell, C++, and Go.

I am fluent in German, English, and Russian.
